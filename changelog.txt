- game only runs at 60 fps now for simplicity. I've been experimenting with gaffers and dewitters game loops
  and they just add a lot of complexity to the game without bringing much to the table for a game this small.
  I'm especially having trouble with lost keyboard inputs with those loops and haven't found a solution yet.
- fixed a bug where a dead player could reflect bullelts with shield.
- all pos_x and pos_y are now float instead of int.
- made swamp a bit more lenient.
- added default unit move speed in data class. all units use this speed now. easier for tweaking speeds.
- it's now the weapon class that shoots a bullet, not the unit class.
