# Open Curse of Sherwood

A work-in-progress open-source remake of the classic C64 game "The Curse of Sherwood" by Mastertronic.

The game is written in VSCode editor with C# as language and is using the Raylib game framework.

You can run the game by opening the code in VScode or possibly Visual Studio and running it from there with F5.

Alternatively you can copy the 'assets' folder into the 'bin\Debug\net7.0' folder and run 'open cos.exe'.
